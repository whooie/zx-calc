- add circuit extraction
- add wire types and additional graph normal forms (e.g. "graph-like" diagrams)
- add "auto-simplifying" `add_wire` (will likely need to restrict to ZX only)
- add non-ketbra-reliant scalar computation
- add a specialized graph type for Clifford+T circuits that achieves efficient
  computation/simplification guaranteed by the Gottesman-Knill theorem
